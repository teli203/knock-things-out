/* Suggestions for things to add 2.15.25 */

/* 1: Deeper style */
/* 2: Section off each section creating a more visual layout */
/* 3: Maybe the notes could be added to the completed tasks like for a more indepth description of tasks */
/* 4: Expand the tasks list to beyond just a day. Maybe a day/week/month type deal */
/* 5: Possibly add animation to make less of a flat site, with check marks for compelete or better break down of tasks as completed */
/* 6: Add more to notes like a clear or submit section. As on now it just sits there as is with no purpose of action. */
/* 7: Maybe have the whole tasks list once completed can be stored or emailed of some sort of record to look back on, but that requires storage with a back end */
/* 8: Figure out why prettier requires the smart a an errors out the regular ' markings. Take a deeper dive into functionality of envoking prettier */
